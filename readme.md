## 📋 Project Overview

The project is divided into the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Overview**:
   - Load the dataset and inspect its structure, dimensions, and basic statistics.

2. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - Analyze individual variables to understand their distribution and characteristics.

3. **Multivariate Analysis**:
   - Explore relationships between multiple variables using correlation and visualizations.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use a variety of plots (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots, violin plots) to analyze the data.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading and Overview
- **Dataset**: `housing.csv`
- **Libraries Used**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Key operations:
  - Inspect the dataset using `.head()`, `.shape`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.
  - Check for missing values and duplicates.

### 2. Univariate Analysis
- Analyze individual variables:
  - Identify categorical and numerical features.
  - Check the skewness of numerical features.
  - Visualize distributions using histograms and box plots.

### 3. Multivariate Analysis
- Explore relationships between variables:
  - Correlation matrix and heatmap for numerical features.
  - Pair plots for scatterplot analysis.
  - Analyze relationships between categorical and numerical variables.

### 4. Data Visualization
- Generate various plots to analyze data:
  - **Box Plot**: Identify outliers.
  - **Violin Plot**: Visualize data distribution and density.
  - **Scatter Plot**: Analyze relationships between variables.
  - **Heatmap**: Visualize correlations.
  - **Histogram**: Understand frequency distribution.
  - **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**: Analyze data density.
